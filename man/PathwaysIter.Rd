\usage{
PathwaysIter(List, Selection = NULL, geneExpr = NULL, nrclusters = NULL,
  method = c("limma", "MLP"), geneInfo = NULL, geneSetSource = "GOBP",
  topP = NULL, topG = NULL, GENESET = NULL, sign = 0.05, niter = 10,
  fusionsLog = TRUE, weightclust = TRUE, names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{List}{A list of clustering outputs or output of the\code{DiffGenes}
function. The first element of the list will be used as the reference in
\code{ReorderToReference}. The output of \code{ChooseFeatures} is also
accepted.}

\item{Selection}{If pathway analysis should be conducted for a specific
selection of objects, this selection can be provided here. Selection can
be of the type "character" (names of the objects) or "numeric" (the number
of specific cluster). Default is NULL.}

\item{geneExpr}{The gene expression matrix of the objects. The rows should
correspond with the genes.}

\item{nrclusters}{The number of clusters to cut the dendrogram in. Default is NULL.}

\item{method}{The method to applied to look for differentially expressed genes and related pathways. For now, only the
limma method is available for gene analysis and the MLP method for pathway analysis. Default is c("limma","MLP").}

\item{geneInfo}{A data frame with at least the columns ENTREZID and SYMBOL.
This is necessary to connect the symbolic names of the genes with their
EntrezID in the correct order. The order of the gene is here not in the
order of the rownames of the gene expression matrix but in the order of
their significance. Default is NULL.}

\item{geneSetSource}{The source for the getGeneSets function ("GOBP",
"GOMF","GOCC", "KEGG" or "REACTOME"). Default is "GOBP".}

\item{topP}{Overrules sign. The number of pathways to display for each
cluster. If not specified, only the significant genes are shown. Default is NULL.}

\item{topG}{Overrules sign. The number of top genes to be returned in the
result. If not specified, only the significant genes are shown. Default is NULL.}

\item{GENESET}{Optional. Can provide own candidate gene sets. Default is NULL.}

\item{sign}{The significance level to be handled. Default is 0.05.}

\item{niter}{The number of times to perform pathway analysis. Default is 10.}

\item{fusionsLog}{Logical. To be handed to \code{ReorderToReference}: indicator for the fusion of clusters. Default is TRUE}

\item{weightclust}{Logical. To be handed to \code{ReorderToReference}: to be used for the outputs of CEC,
WeightedClust or WeightedSimClust. If TRUE, only the result of the Clust element is considered. Default is TRUE.}

\item{names}{Optional. Names of the methods. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
This element is again a list with the following four elements:
\item{objects}{A list with the elements LeadCpds (the objects of
interest) and OrderedCpds (all objects in the order of the clustering
result)} \item{Characteristics}{The found (top) characteristics of the
feauture data} \item{Genes}{A list with the elements TopDE (a table with
information on the top genes) and AllDE (a table with information on all
genes)} \item{Pathways}{A list with the element ranked.genesets.table which
is a data frame containing the genesets, their p-values and their
descriptions. The second element is nr.genesets and contains the used and
total number of genesets.}
}
\description{
The MLP method to perform pathway analysis is based on resampling of the
data. Therefore it is recommended to perform the pathway analysis multiple
times to observe how much the results are influenced by a different
resample. The function \code{PathwaysIter} performs the pathway analysis as
described in \code{Pathways} a specified number of times. The input can be
one data set or a list as in \code{Pathway.2} and \code{Pathways}.
