\title{A heatmap of similarity values between objects}
\usage{
SimilarityHeatmap(Data, type = c("data", "clust", "sim", "dist"),
  distmeasure = "tanimoto", normalize = FALSE, method = NULL,
  linkage = "flexible", cutoff = NULL, percentile = FALSE,
  plottype = "new", location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{The data of which a heatmap should be drawn.}

\item{type}{indicates whether the provided matrices in "List" are either data matrices, distance
matrices or clustering results obtained from the data. If type="dist" the calculation of the distance
matrices is skipped and if type="clusters" the single source clustering is skipped.
Type should be one of "data", "dist" ,"sim" or "clusters".}

\item{distmeasure}{The distance measure. Should be one of "tanimoto", "euclidean", "jaccard", "hamming". Defaults to "tanimoto".}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Indicates whether to normalize the distance matrices or not, defaults to c(FALSE, FALSE) for two data sets. This is recommended if different distance types are used. More details on normalization in \code{Normalization}.}

\item{method}{A method of normalization. Should be one of "Quantile","Fisher-Yates", "standardize","Range" or any of the first letters of these names. Default is NULL.}

\item{linkage}{Choice of inter group dissimilarity (character). Defaults to "flexible".}

\item{cutoff}{Optional. If a cutoff value is specified, all values lower are
put to zero while all other values are kept. This helps to highlight the
most similar objects. Default is NULL.}

\item{percentile}{Logical. The cutoff value can be a percentile. If one want
the cutoff value to be the 90th percentile of the data, one should specify
cutoff = 0.90 and percentile = TRUE. Default is FALSE.}

\item{plottype}{Should be one of "pdf","new" or "sweave". If "pdf", a
location should be provided in "location" and the figure is saved there. If
"new" a new graphic device is opened and if "sweave", the figure is made
compatible to appear in a sweave or knitr document, i.e. no new device is
opened and the plot appears in the current device or document. Default is "new".}

\item{location}{If plottype is "pdf", a location should be provided in
"location" and the figure is saved there. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A heatmap with the names of the objects on the right and bottom
and a dendrogram of the clustering at the left and top.
}
\description{
The function \code{SimilarityHeatmap} plots the similarity values between
objects. The darker the shade, the more similar objects are. The option
is available to set a cutoff value to highlight the most similar objects.
}
\details{
If data is of type "clust", the distance matrix is extracted from the result
and transformed to a similarity matrix. Possibly a range normalization is
performed. If data is of type "dist", it is also transformed to a similarity
matrix and cluster is performed on the distances. If data is of type "sim",
the data is tranformed to a distance matrix on which clustering is
performed. Once the similarity mattrix is obtained, the cutoff value is
applied and a heatmap is drawn. If no cutoff value is desired, one can leave
the default NULL specification.
