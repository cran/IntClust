\title{Colouring clusters in a dendrogram}
\usage{
ClusterPlot(Data1, Data2 = NULL, nrclusters = NULL, cols = NULL,
  colorComps = NULL, hangdend = 0.02, plottype = "new", location = NULL,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data1}{The resulting clustering of a method which contains the
dendrogram to be colored.}

\item{Data2}{Optional. The resulting clustering of another method , i.e. the
resulting clustering on which the colors should be based. Default is NULL.}

\item{nrclusters}{Optional. The number of clusters to cut the dendrogram in.
If not specified the dendrogram will be drawn without colours to discern the
different clusters. Default is NULL.}

\item{cols}{The colours for the clusters if nrclusters is specified. Default is NULL.}

\item{colorComps}{If only a specific set of objects needs to be
highlighted, this can be specified here. The objects should be given in a
character vector. If specified, all other compound labels will be colored
black. Default is NULL.}

\item{hangdend}{A specification for the length of the brances of the dendrogram. Default is 0.02.}

\item{plottype}{Should be one of "pdf","new" or "sweave". If "pdf", a
location should be provided in "location" and the figure is saved there. If
"new" a new graphic device is opened and if "sweave", the figure is made
compatible to appear in a sweave or knitr document. Default is "new".}

\item{location}{If plottype is "pdf", a location should be provided in
"location" and the figure is saved there. Default is NULL.}

\item{\dots}{Other options which can be given to the plot function.}
}
\value{
A plot of the dendrogram of the first clustering result with colored
leaves. If a second clustering result is given in Data2, the colors are
based on this clustering result.
}
\description{
Plot a dendrogram with leaves colored by a result of choice.
