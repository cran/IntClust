\title{Plot of continuous features}
\usage{
ContFeaturesPlot(leadCpds, data, nrclusters = NULL, orderLab = NULL,
  colorLab = NULL, cols = NULL, ylab = "features", addLegend = TRUE,
  margins = c(5.5, 3.5, 0.5, 8.7), plottype = "new", location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{leadCpds}{A character vector containing the objects one wants to
separate from the others.}

\item{data}{The data matrix.}

\item{nrclusters}{Optional. The number of clusters to consider if colorLab
is specified. Default is NULL.}

\item{orderLab}{Optional. If the objects are to set in a specific order of
a specific method. Default is NULL.}

\item{colorLab}{The clustering result that determines the color of the
labels of the objects in the plot. If NULL, the labels are black. Default is NULL.}

\item{cols}{The colors for the labels of the objects. Default is NULL.}

\item{ylab}{The lable of the y-axis. Default is "features".}

\item{addLegend}{Logical. Indicates whether a legend should be added to the
plot. Default is TRUE.}

\item{margins}{Optional. Margins to be used for the plot. Default is c(5.5,3.5,0.5,8.7).}

\item{plottype}{Should be one of "pdf","new" or "sweave". If "pdf", a
location should be provided in "location" and the figure is saved there. If
"new" a new graphic device is opened and if "sweave", the figure is made
compatible to appear in a sweave or knitr document, i.e. no new device is
opened and the plot appears in the current device or document. Default is "new".}

\item{location}{If plottype is "pdf", a location should be provided in
"location" and the figure is saved there. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A plot in which the values of the features of the leadCpds are
separeted from the others.
}
\description{
The function \code{ContFeaturesPlot} plots the values of continuous features. 
It is possible to separate between objects of interest and the
other objects.
