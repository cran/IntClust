\description{
In order to facilitate the visualization of the influence of the different
methods on the clustering of the objects, colours can be used. The function
\code{ColorPalette} is able to pick out as many colours as there are
clusters. This is done with the help of the \code{ColorRampPalette} function
of the grDevices package
