\title{Pathway analysis for multiple clustering results}
\usage{
Pathways(List, Selection = NULL, geneExpr = NULL, nrclusters = NULL,
  method = c("limma", "MLP"), geneInfo = NULL, geneSetSource = "GOBP",
  topP = NULL, topG = NULL, GENESET = NULL, sign = 0.05,
  fusionsLog = TRUE, weightclust = TRUE, names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{List}{A list of clustering outputs or output of the\code{DiffGenes}
function. The first element of the list will be used as the reference in
\code{ReorderToReference}. The output of \code{ChooseFeatures} is also
accepted.}

\item{Selection}{If pathway analysis should be conducted for a specific
selection of objects, this selection can be provided here. Selection can
be of the type "character" (names of the objects) or "numeric" (the number
of specific cluster). Default is NULL.}

\item{geneExpr}{The gene expression matrix or ExpressionSet of the objects.
The rows should correspond with the genes.}

\item{nrclusters}{Optional. The number of clusters to cut the dendrogram in.
The number of clusters should not be specified if the interest lies only in
a specific selection of objects which is known by name.  Otherwise, it is
required. Default is NULL.}

\item{method}{The method to applied to look for differentially expressed genes and related pathways. For now, only the
limma method is available for gene analysis and the MLP method for pathway analysis. Default is c("limma","MLP").}

\item{geneInfo}{A data frame with at least the columns ENTREZID and SYMBOL.
This is necessary to connect the symbolic names of the genes with their
EntrezID in the correct order. The order of the gene is here not in the
order of the rownames of the gene expression matrix but in the order of
their significance. Default is NULL.}

\item{geneSetSource}{The source for the getGeneSets function, defaults to
"GOBP".}

\item{topP}{Overrules sign. The number of pathways to display for each
cluster. If not specified, only the significant genes are shown. Default is NULL.}

\item{topG}{Overrules sign. The number of top genes to be returned in the
result. If not specified, only the significant genes are shown. Defaults is NULL.}

\item{GENESET}{Optional. Can provide own candidate gene sets. Default is NULL.}

\item{sign}{The significance level to be handled. Default is 0.05.}

\item{fusionsLog}{Logical. To be handed to \code{ReorderToReference}: indicator for the fusion of clusters. Default is TRUE}

\item{weightclust}{Logical. To be handed to \code{ReorderToReference}: to be used for the outputs of CEC,
WeightedClust or WeightedSimClust. If TRUE, only the result of the Clust element is considered. Default is TRUE.}

\item{names}{Optional. Names of the methods. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
The returned value is a list with an element per cluster per method.
This element is again a list with the following four elements:
\item{objects}{A list with the elements LeadCpds (the objects of
interest) and OrderedCpds (all objects in the order of the clustering
result)} \item{Characteristics}{The found (top) characteristics of the
feauture data} \item{Genes}{A list with the elements TopDE (a table with
information on the top genes) and AllDE (a table with information on all
genes)} \item{Pathways}{A list with the element ranked.genesets.table which
is a data frame containing the genesets, their p-values and their
descriptions. The second element is nr.genesets and contains the used and
total number of genesets.}
}
\description{
A pathway analysis per cluster per method is conducted.

\details{
After finding differently expressed genes, it can be investigated whether
pathways are related to those genes. This can be done with the help of the
function \code{Pathways} which makes use of the \code{MLP} function of the
MLP package. Given the output of a method, the cutree function is performed
which results into a specific number of clusters. For each cluster, the
limma method is performed comparing this cluster to the other clusters. This
to obtain the necessary p-values of the genes. These are used as the input
for the \code{MLP} function to find interesting pathways. By default the
candidate gene sets are determined by the \code{AnnotateEntrezIDtoGO}
function. The default source will be GOBP, but this can be altered.
Further, it is also possible to provide own candidate gene sets in the form
of a list of pathway categories in which each component contains a vector of
Entrez Gene identifiers related to that particular pathway. The default
values for the minimum and maximum number of genes in a gene set for it to
be considered were used. For MLP this is respectively 5 and 100. If a list
of outputs of several methods is provided as data input, the cluster numbers
are rearranged according to a reference method. The first method is taken as
the reference and ReorderToReference is applied to get the correct ordering.
When the clusters haven been re-appointed, the pathway analysis as described
above is performed for each cluster of each method.
