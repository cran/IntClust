\title{Box plots of one distance matrix categorized against another distance
matrix.}
\usage{
BoxPlotDistance(Data1, Data2, type = c("data", "dist", "clusters"),
  distmeasure = c("tanimoto", "tanimoto"), normalize = c(FALSE, FALSE),
  method = c(NULL, NULL), lab1, lab2, limits1 = NULL, limits2 = NULL,
  plot = 1, StopRange = FALSE, plottype = "new", location = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data1}{The first data matrix, cluster outcome or distance matrix to be
plotted.}

\item{Data2}{The second data matrix, cluster outcome or distance matrix to
be plotted.}

\item{type}{indicates whether the provided matrices in "List" are either data matrices, distance
matrices or clustering results obtained from the data. If type="dist" the calculation of the distance
matrices is skipped and if type="clusters" the single source clustering is skipped.
Type should be one of "data", "dist" or "clusters".}

\item{distmeasure}{A vector of the distance measures to be used on each data matrix. Should be one of "tanimoto", "euclidean", "jaccard", "hamming". Defaults to c("tanimoto","tanimoto").}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Indicates whether to normalize the distance matrices or not, defaults to c(FALSE, FALSE) for two data sets. This is recommended if different distance types are used. More details on normalization in \code{Normalization}.}

\item{method}{A method of normalization. Should be one of "Quantile","Fisher-Yates", "standardize","Range" or any of the first letters of these names. Default is c(NULL,NULL) for two data sets.}

\item{lab1}{The label to plot for Data1.}

\item{lab2}{The label to plot for Data2.}

\item{limits1}{The limits for the categories of Data1.}

\item{limits2}{The limits for the categories of Data2.}

\item{plot}{The type of plots: 1 - Plot the values of Data1 versus the
categories of Data2. 2 - Plot the values of Data2 versus the categories of
Data1. 3 - Plot both types 1 and 2.}

\item{StopRange}{Logical. Indicates whether the distance matrices with
values not between zero and one should be standardized to have so. If FALSE
the range normalization is performed. See \code{Normalization}. If TRUE, the
distance matrices are not changed. This is recommended if different types of
data are used such that these are comparable. Default is FALSE.}

\item{plottype}{Should be one of "pdf","new" or "sweave". If "pdf", a
location should be provided in "location" and the figure is saved there. If
"new" a new graphic device is opened and if "sweave", the figure is made
compatible to appear in a sweave or knitr document, i.e. no new device is
opened and the plot appears in the current device or document. Default is "new".}

\item{location}{If plottype is "pdf", a location should be provided in
"location" and the figure is saved there. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
One/multiple box plots.
}
\description{
Given two distance matrices, the function categorizes one distance matrix
and produces a box plot from the other distance matrix against the created
categories. The option is available to choose one of the plots or to have
both plots. The function also works on outputs from ADEC and CEC functions
which do not have distance matrices but incidence matrices.
